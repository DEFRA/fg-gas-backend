# Dev ways of working

## Starting...

### Tickets should have amigo as soon as possible
* At least the dev, QA and BA should be present, others if required
* You can start working on a ticket before amigo, but the amigo should happen as soon as possible

## Finishing...

### Tickets should be demoed
* Demo to QA and anybody else interested (watching on Jira)
* Maybe beneficial if the tester can also run changes locally

### Code reviews
* Refer to requirements in Jira
* Dev should explain the code to another dev
* Maybe less thorough if the ticket was paired on

### Test in the environment
* Tester should test the ticket in the environment
* Dev may wish to validate the ticket in the environment
